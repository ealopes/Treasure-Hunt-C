# Treasure-Hunt-C
These are just the files from my 3rd homework in a CS class.
It's a treasure hunting game where you can create a houseGraph file, specify the max number of rooms, and max treasure, and then play.
Pretty boring, I just want a place to keep it in case my laptop crashes in the future and I ever use C again.
